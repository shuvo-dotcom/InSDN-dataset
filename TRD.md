Technical Requirements Document (TRD)
1. System Architecture Overview
The architecture is divided into several modular components to ensure scalability and maintainability:
Data Ingestion Module:
 Collects raw network traffic data from various sources.
Data Preprocessing Pipeline:
 Cleans and normalizes data, extracting relevant features.
Dynamic Analysis Engine:
 Combines classical ML and LLM-based methods for anomaly detection.
Agent-based Adaptation Layer:
 Implements autonomous agents to refine prompts and adjust model parameters dynamically.
Visualization and Reporting Module:
 Dashboards and reporting tools for real-time analysis and historical review.
Monitoring & Feedback Loop:
 Continuous model evaluation and automated fine-tuning mechanisms.
2. Detailed Module Descriptions
Data Ingestion and Preprocessing
Responsibilities:
Load raw data from the InSDN dataset.
Normalize and preprocess data (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.).
Extract key features such as packet rates, protocol types, connection durations, and anomalies.
Technologies:
 Python (pandas, NumPy), Apache Kafka or similar for real-time ingestion (if required).
Dynamic Analysis Engine
Responsibilities:
Leverage LLM-based models to analyze network traffic.
Use dynamic prompting techniques to adapt to new patterns.
Optionally, integrate a hybrid approach with classical ML for baseline detection.
Technologies:
 Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch/TensorFlow, and prompt engineering frameworks.
Agent-based Adaptation Layer
Responsibilities:
Deploy intelligent agents that monitor performance metrics.
Trigger adjustments in prompting strategies or model parameters when performance drops.
Implement reinforcement learning (or similar techniques) for autonomous adaptation.
Technologies:
 Python, multi-agent frameworks, reinforcement learning libraries.
Visualization and Reporting
Responsibilities:
Provide real-time dashboards showing detected anomalies and traffic patterns.
Generate detailed reports for post-event analysis.
Technologies:
 Web frameworks (e.g., Flask, Django), data visualization libraries (e.g., Plotly, D3.js).
Monitoring & Feedback
Responsibilities:
Continuously monitor model performance.
Provide feedback for automated retraining or fine-tuning.
Technologies:
 Logging frameworks, monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana).
3. Data Flow and Integration
Data Collection:
 Raw network traffic data is collected and stored in the /data/raw directory.
Preprocessing:
 Data is cleaned, normalized, and features are extracted in the /src/data_preprocessing module.
Analysis:
 The dynamic analysis engine processes the data using LLM-based and classical ML models.
Adaptation:
 Agent modules in /src/agents adjust parameters dynamically based on feedback.
Visualization:
 Processed results are visualized and stored in /experiments/results and shown on dashboards.
Feedback Loop:
 Continuous performance monitoring informs periodic model updates.
