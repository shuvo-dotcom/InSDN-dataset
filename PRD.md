Product Requirements Document (PRD)
1. Overview
Project Name: InSDN Traffic Analysis
 Objective:
 Analyze network traffic from the InSDN dataset to detect various attack patterns. While classical machine learning models can be effective, the aim is to develop a dynamic solution that can adapt to evolving attack patterns using LLM techniques (prompting, dynamic prompting, and agent-based methods).
2. Problem Statement
Challenge:
 Traditional machine learning solutions require re-training or fine-tuning when new attack patterns develop, leading to delayed responses and potential security gaps.
Solution:
 Implement a dynamic analysis framework using Large Language Models (LLMs) and intelligent agents to adaptively interpret and classify evolving network attack patterns without continuous manual re-training.
3. Objectives and Goals
Primary Objectives:
Develop a dynamic, adaptive system for detecting traffic patterns associated with various network attacks.
Reduce the need for continuous manual fine-tuning as new attack vectors emerge.
Secondary Objectives:
Create an intuitive interface and reporting mechanism for network security analysts.
Establish a robust and scalable system architecture to integrate with existing network monitoring tools.
Validate the approach through rigorous testing on historical and simulated data.
4. Target Audience
Primary Users: Network security analysts, cybersecurity teams, and incident response units.
Secondary Users: Researchers in cybersecurity and data science engineers focusing on anomaly detection and adaptive systems.
5. Key Use Cases
Real-time Attack Detection:
 Analysts receive alerts and detailed analyses when anomalous traffic patterns indicative of attacks are detected.
Post-event Analysis:
 In-depth forensic analysis of network traffic post-incident to understand attack vectors and refine defense strategies.
Adaptive Model Update:
 System autonomously adjusts analysis parameters using LLM-guided dynamic prompting and agents when new traffic patterns emerge.
