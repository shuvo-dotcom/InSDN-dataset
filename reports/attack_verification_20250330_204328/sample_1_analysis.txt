### 1. Attack Classification

#### Likelihood of Malicious Intent: 85%
- **Type of Attack Suggestion**: This pattern suggests a potential scanning or reconnaissance activity, possibly a part of a larger, more complex attack pattern such as a Denial of Service (DoS) or a network probe to identify open ports and services.
- **Key Indicators**:
  - **Total Forward Packets**: 0.0, and **Total Backward Packets**: 2.0, indicating a one-sided communication, which is atypical for benign traffic.
  - **Packet Length Stats**: Min, Max, Mean, and Std Dev all at 0.0, which is highly unusual and suggests no actual data was transferred.
  - **Flag Analysis**: The presence of **FIN** and **ACK** flags without accompanying **SYN** flags is indicative of a FIN scan, a technique used to identify listening ports on a target machine stealthily.
  - **Protocol Behavior**: The **Source Port** being 80 suggests a response from a web server, but with no forward packets, it raises suspicions about the legitimacy of the session.
- **Comparison to Known Attack Patterns**: The observed behavior closely matches that of a FIN scan, where attackers send FIN packets to bypass firewall rules, expecting no response from closed ports and a response from open or filtered ports.

### 2. Threat Analysis

- **Potential Security Implications**: Unauthorized reconnaissance and mapping of network resources, leading to further targeted attacks.
- **Estimated Severity Level**: Medium
- **Possible Attack Vectors**: Utilizing the FIN scan technique to probe network services without establishing a full TCP connection, potentially evading detection.
- **Threat Level**: 7/10
  - **Justification**: While the immediate impact might be low, the information gathered through such reconnaissance can enable more severe attacks, indicating a preparatory phase of a multi-stage attack.
- **Immediate and Potential Future Impacts**: Immediate impacts are minimal, but future impacts could include targeted attacks on identified services, exploitation of vulnerabilities, or a full-scale DoS attack.

### 3. Network Behavior Analysis

- **Suspicious Patterns**:
  - **Packet Flow Characteristics**: The absence of forward packets and the presence of backward packets only is highly unusual.
  - **Timing Patterns**: The **Flow IAT Mean** and **Backward IAT Mean** both being 8829.0 with a Std Dev of 0.0 indicates a lack of normal traffic variability.
  - **Flag Usage**: The combination of **FIN** and **ACK** flags without **SYN** flags deviates from the typical handshake process of TCP connections.
  - **Protocol Behavior**: Communication originating from a standard HTTP port without any data transfer is suspicious, especially in the context of the other indicators.
- **Comparison to Normal Traffic Patterns**: Normal traffic would typically show a mix of forward and backward packets, with packet length stats reflecting actual data transfer. The flag usage would follow the standard TCP three-way handshake process.

### 4. Recommendations

- **Security Measures**:
  - Implementing strict firewall rules to block incoming packets with FIN flags that do not belong to an established connection.
  - Employing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) with signatures to detect FIN scans and other reconnaissance activities.
- **Monitoring or Detection Rules**:
  - Alert on TCP packets with FIN flags where no SYN flag was observed for the session.
  - Monitor for asymmetrical packet flows (e.g., all backward, no forward packets) over standard service ports.
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Investigate hosts and services on the receiving end of these packets for potential vulnerabilities.
  - Temporarily block IPs where suspicious packets originate from until a thorough investigation is completed.
- **Firewall Rules or IDS Signatures**:
  - IDS Signature: `alert tcp any any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"Possible FIN Scan Detected"; flags:F,12; ack:0; seq:0; classtype:attempted-recon; sid:1000001; rev:1;)`
  - Firewall Rule: Block incoming connections on port 80 that have a FIN flag set without accompanying SYN/ACK flags.

These recommendations aim to mitigate the immediate threat and enhance the network's resilience against similar reconnaissance activities.
