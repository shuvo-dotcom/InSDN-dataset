### Attack Classification

**Likelihood of Malicious Traffic:** 60-70%

**Type of Attack Suggestion:** The pattern suggests a potential reconnaissance or scanning activity, possibly a SYN scan.

**Key Indicators:**
- **SYN Flags:** The presence of SYN flags (1.0) without corresponding ACK flags indicates an attempt to establish a connection but not completing the handshake, which is characteristic of SYN scanning.
- **Packet Size Distribution:** The minimal packet sizes (Min: 0.0, Max: 30.0, Mean: 6.666666667) are indicative of packets that are not carrying significant payloads, which aligns with scanning activities where the attacker is more interested in mapping the network rather than transferring data.
- **Flow Duration and Packet Rates:** The relatively short flow duration (34973.0 ms) combined with a balanced forward and backward packet count (4.0 each) suggests a brief and possibly automated interaction typical of scanning tools.
- **Protocol and Port Usage:** The use of Protocol 6 (TCP) and destination port 80 suggests targeting web services, a common focus for attackers looking to exploit web vulnerabilities.

**Comparison with Known Attack Patterns:** The characteristics align with known patterns of SYN scanning, where attackers send SYN packets to various ports to identify open services.

### Threat Analysis

**Potential Security Implications:** Unauthorized reconnaissance and mapping of network services, leading to information disclosure about active services and potentially vulnerable entry points.

**Estimated Severity Level:** Medium

**Possible Attack Vectors:** Utilization of automated scanning tools to discover open ports and services for future exploitation.

**Threat Level Rating:** 5/10
- **Justification:** While the detected activity suggests preliminary reconnaissance rather than direct exploitation, it indicates an attacker's interest and potential precursor to more severe attacks.

**Immediate and Potential Future Impacts:** Immediate impact is limited to potential information disclosure. However, the future impact could include targeted attacks on discovered services, leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or service disruption.

### Network Behavior Analysis

**Suspicious Patterns:**
- **Packet Flow Characteristics:** The equal number of forward and backward packets with minimal payload sizes is atypical for legitimate traffic, which usually exhibits more variability in packet sizes and counts based on the application.
- **Timing Patterns:** The mean inter-arrival times (Flow IAT Mean: 4996.142857, Forward IAT Mean: 8906.0, Backward IAT Mean: 6288.0) and their standard deviations suggest automated, periodic packet transmission rather than human-driven interaction.
- **Flag Usage:** The exclusive use of SYN flags without ACK flags in the context of TCP traffic is a hallmark of SYN scanning.
- **Protocol Behavior:** The source port (43374) and destination port (80) usage is typical for web traffic, but in the context of other indicators, it suggests targeting rather than normal browsing or service use.

**Comparison to Normal Traffic Patterns:** Normal web traffic would typically show a completion of the TCP three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK), varied packet sizes reflecting actual data exchange, and less regular timing patterns reflecting human or complex application behavior.

### Recommendations

**Security Measures:**
- Implement intrusion detection systems (IDS) with signatures to detect SYN scan attempts.
- Employ stateful firewalls that can recognize and block incomplete TCP handshakes or unusual packet patterns.
- Harden exposed services on port 80 and other common ports by ensuring they are up-to-date and configured securely.

**Monitoring or Detection Rules:**
- Alert on SYN packets to common ports that do not result in a completed TCP handshake.
- Monitor for patterns of traffic with minimal packet sizes and regular inter-arrival times.

**Immediate Actions:**
- Investigate the source of the scanning attempts to determine the scope and potential targets within the network.
- Temporarily block IPs associated with suspicious SYN scanning at the firewall level.

**Firewall Rules or IDS Signatures:**
- Block incoming connections that only send SYN packets without completing the handshake.
- Signature for IDS: Alert on multiple SYN requests from the same IP to different ports within a short time frame without corresponding ACKs.

**Preventive and Detective Controls:**
- Regularly update and patch services exposed on common ports to reduce vulnerability to exploits.
- Implement network segmentation to limit the scope of access should an attacker gain a foothold.
- Continuously monitor network traffic for anomalies and adjust security controls based on emerging threat patterns.
