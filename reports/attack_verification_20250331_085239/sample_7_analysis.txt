### Attack Classification

- **Confidence in Malicious Intent**: 80%
- **Type of Attack Suggested**: This pattern suggests a possible SYN scan or reconnaissance activity.
- **Key Indicators**:
  - **SYN Flags**: The presence of a SYN flag without corresponding ACK flags is indicative of SYN scanning, used to identify open ports on a target machine.
  - **Total Forward Packets**: 0, indicating no actual data was sent, which aligns with scanning activities where the attacker does not establish a full connection.
  - **Total Backward Packets**: 2, possibly the responses from the scanned host.
  - **Protocol**: 6 (TCP), which is commonly used for initial handshake attempts in reconnaissance activities.
  - **Source and Destination Ports**: The use of a high source port number (40507) and a specific destination port (1147) could indicate scanning for services running on non-standard ports.

### Threat Analysis

- **Potential Security Implications**: Unauthorized reconnaissance and mapping of network services, leading to further targeted attacks.
- **Estimated Severity Level**: Medium.
- **Possible Attack Vectors**: Utilizing SYN scans to discover open ports and potentially vulnerable services.
- **Threat Level**: 7/10. While the immediate impact might be low, the information gathered could be used for more severe attacks.
- **Immediate and Future Impacts**: Immediate impact is low as no data is exchanged, but future impacts could include exploitation of discovered services.

### Network Behavior Analysis

- **Suspicious Patterns**:
  - **Packet Flow Characteristics**: The absence of forward packets and the presence of backward packets without data transfer are unusual.
  - **Timing Patterns**: The flow duration and backward IAT mean being equal suggests automated scanning with precise timing.
  - **Flag Usage**: The SYN flag without an ACK flag in response is not typical for legitimate traffic.
  - **Protocol Behavior**: Scanning on a non-standard port (1147) is suspicious, as common services usually run on well-known ports.
- **Comparison to Normal Traffic**:
  - Normal traffic typically involves a SYN, followed by a SYN-ACK, and then an ACK to establish a connection, which is not observed here.
  - The packet sizes and lack of data transfer are not typical for legitimate TCP connections.

### Recommendations

- **Security Measures**:
  - Implementing network segmentation to limit reconnaissance scope.
  - Deploying Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to detect and alert on SYN scan signatures.
- **Monitoring/Detection Rules**:
  - Alert on TCP connections that only contain a SYN flag without progression to established connections.
  - Monitor for high rates of SYN packets targeting multiple ports from a single source IP.
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Temporarily block IPs identified in scanning activities at the firewall level.
  - Investigate logs for other signs of reconnaissance or attempted breaches.
- **Firewall Rules/IDS Signatures**:
  - Block incoming connections with only a SYN flag set and no subsequent ACK.
  - Create IDS signatures to detect rapid sequences of SYN packets to multiple ports, indicative of scanning.
- **Preventive and Detective Controls**:
  - Regularly update firewall and IDS signatures based on emerging threats.
  - Conduct vulnerability assessments on ports found to be open to ensure services are secure.

This analysis is based on the provided metrics and patterns, which strongly suggest reconnaissance activity, possibly as a precursor to more targeted attacks. Implementing the recommended controls can help mitigate potential threats.
