### 1. Attack Classification

- **Confidence Level**: 75%
- **Type of Attack**: The traffic sample suggests a potential reconnaissance or scanning attack.
- **Key Indicators**:
  - **Protocol and Port Usage**: The source port is 80 (HTTP), and the destination port is 40849, which is non-standard and atypical for HTTP traffic, indicating possible scanning for open ports or services.
  - **Packet Length Stats**: The maximum packet length is 30 bytes, with a mean of 5.454545455 and a standard deviation of 12.13559752. These small and inconsistent packet sizes are unusual for legitimate HTTP traffic, suggesting probing activities.
  - **Flag Analysis**: The presence of 1 FIN flag and 1 ACK flag without corresponding SYN flags is atypical, as FIN flags are generally seen at the end of a TCP session, not in isolation or without preceding SYN flags in legitimate connections.
  - **Timing Patterns**: The flow inter-arrival times (IAT) have a high standard deviation (8887.679854 for Flow IAT Std), indicating irregular timing that could be associated with automated scanning tools.

### 2. Threat Analysis

- **Potential Security Implications**: Unauthorized reconnaissance or scanning can lead to the discovery of vulnerable services, which could be exploited in future attacks.
- **Estimated Severity Level**: Medium
- **Possible Attack Vectors**: The attacker might be using automated scanning tools to identify open ports and services for future exploitation.
- **Threat Level**: 6/10
  - **Justification**: While the current traffic does not indicate an active exploitation, reconnaissance is a critical first step in most attack chains, indicating a preparatory phase for potentially more severe attacks.
- **Immediate and Potential Future Impacts**: Immediate impact is low, as reconnaissance itself does not disrupt services. However, the information gathered could be used for more severe attacks, such as exploiting discovered vulnerabilities, leading to unauthorized access or data breaches.

### 3. Network Behavior Analysis

- **Suspicious Patterns**:
  - **Packet Flow Characteristics**: The forward/backward ratio of 2.0 and the small packet sizes are unusual for normal HTTP traffic, indicating potential scanning or probing.
  - **Timing Patterns**: The high standard deviation in flow IAT suggests automated, irregular traffic patterns, unlike human-generated traffic.
  - **Flag Usage**: The use of FIN and ACK flags without SYN flags is not typical for establishing legitimate TCP connections, indicating possible evasion techniques or scanning.
  - **Protocol Behavior**: Usage of HTTP (protocol 6) from a standard port (80) to a high, non-standard port (40849) is not typical for regular web traffic, suggesting scanning or evasion.
- **Comparison to Normal Traffic Patterns**: Normal HTTP traffic would typically show consistent packet sizes with less deviation, regular timing intervals, SYN flags for connection establishment, and communication between standard web service ports (e.g., 80, 443) and client ports.

### 4. Recommendations

- **Security Measures**:
  - Implement network segmentation to limit the scanner's ability to probe internal network resources.
  - Use intrusion detection systems (IDS) to detect and alert on scanning activities.
  - Employ rate limiting on ports to reduce the effectiveness of scanning.
- **Monitoring or Detection Rules**:
  - Alert on TCP traffic with FIN flags without preceding SYN flags.
  - Monitor for irregular packet sizes and timing patterns indicative of scanning.
  - Detect connections to non-standard ports originating from standard service ports.
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Investigate the source of the scanning traffic and block if deemed malicious.
  - Review firewall rules to ensure only necessary ports are open and accessible from the internet.
- **Firewall Rules or IDS Signatures**:
  - Block incoming connections to non-standard ports that should not be publicly accessible.
  - Create IDS signatures to alert on TCP packets with unusual flag combinations or small packet sizes indicative of scanning activities.
- **Preventive and Detective Controls**:
  - Regularly update and patch services to mitigate vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers once discovered through scanning.
  - Employ continuous monitoring and logging of network traffic for analysis and early detection of potential reconnaissance activities.
