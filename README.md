# InSDN Traffic Analysis

A dynamic network traffic analysis system using LLMs and intelligent agents for adaptive attack pattern detection.

## Overview

This project implements an advanced network traffic analysis system that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with intelligent agents to detect and adapt to evolving attack patterns in network traffic data from the InSDN dataset.

## Features

- Dynamic LLM-based traffic pattern analysis
- Agent-based adaptation for autonomous model refinement
- Real-time anomaly detection and classification
- Intuitive visualization and reporting dashboard
- Integration with SIEM systems
